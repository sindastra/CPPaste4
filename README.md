# CPPaste4

**CPPaste4** is a minimalistic web-app used to store and share code pastes. **Kind of like GitHub's Gists!**

It supports all modern browsers but also a bunch of old ones, down to IE8! It also runs on IE6 but that's not officially supported... IE8 is supported for fun. But you should not be using IE8 in 2019... really.

The name is derived from **CPP** (**C++**) and **Paste**!

It's called version **4** as it's the fourth version I'm writing from scratch (each being completely different and with a different goal, this one to be minimalistic) and this version is the first to be open source! See the [Wiki](https://github.com/sindastra/CPPaste4/wiki) for more info.
