# CPPaste4

**CPPaste4** is a minimalistic web-app used to store and share code pastes!

The name is derived from **CPP** (**C++**) and **Paste**!

It's called version **4** as it's the fourth version I'm writing from scratch (each being completely different and with a different goal) and this version is the first to be open source! See the [Wiki](https://github.com/sindastra/CPPaste4/wiki) for more info.
